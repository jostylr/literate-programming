# [literate-programming](# "version:1.1.0; Fat command line for literate-programming")

This is the command line portion of literate-programming. It depends on
literate-programming-lib. 


At the moment, at least, I am of the firm opinion that one should structure a
litpro directory as cache, build, src, lprc.js  as where you start. These
locations can be changed in the command line, but the idea is that you are at
the top, it all goes down. 

Any initially given filenames are read as is. This allows for shell
completion. It is a little odd in that command line is non-prefixed while
loading from within doc is prefixed. One can also specify starting files in
lprc.js by modifying args.files. 

## Directory structure

* [../](# "cd: save")
* [lprc.js](#lprc "save: |jshint") This will define the jshint command
* [package.json](#npm-package "save: | jshint ") The requisite package file for a npm project. 
* [LICENSE](#license-mit "save:  ") The MIT license as I think that is the standard in the node community. 
* [.npmignore](#npmignore "save: ")
* [.gitignore](#gitignore "save: ")
* [.travis.yml](#travis "save: ")
* [](# "cd: save")


## lprc

This imports the jshint command and starts that the build directory is the
current one and the default file to process is this one. 

    /*global module, require */
    module.exports = function(Folder, args) {

        if (args.file.length === 0) {
            args.file = ["project.md"];
        }

        args.src = ".";

        //require('litpro-jshint')(Folder, args);

    };



## NPM package
