-# The Basics

What are we trying to do and how do we do it? This should be enough to get you going. 

### What is literate programming? 

A brief description of the philosophy and history of this mode of programming. 

### LitPro

A description of the tool, hopefully enough to get started with it. 

### Semi-literate programming

The first step towards literate programming, this is where comments become
elevated to be at least as important, if not more important, than the code.
Essentially, comments are the default text mode and code must be initiated. 

### Symphonic programming

Humans do not think in the same way computers process. Respecting the order of
human thought is what symphonic programming is about. We cut up the code in
many pieces, scatter it around and then the program acts as a conductor to put
it all together in a harmonious symphony of beautiful code. 

### Artistic programming

This is the full power of LitPro released. The bits of code can be processed
in arbitrary ways. We are not bound by the dictates of the language and can
craft the code in whatever elegant manner we wish to craft it. With great
power comes the possibilty of making a mess. This is painting code on a canvas
with the blending of the bits and pieces in ways that are very powerful.

### Composition

Insight into how literate programming fits in with the larger pursuit of
efficient programming through powerful compositions. 

### Configuration

A few thoughts on a default setup for using LitPro.
